# Grok Voice Assistant

Grok Voice Assistant is a project that integrates voice interaction capabilities using LiveKit, Deepgram, ElevenLabs, and OpenAI technologies. It consists of a frontend built with Next.js and a backend powered by Python.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: There are two frontend:
  **Simple** : Located in the `frontend-nextjs` directory, this part of the application handles user interactions and displays the voice assistant interface.
  **Complex** : Located in the `grok-agent-playground` directory, this is a modified version to simplify the video, logo, and a few other things of LiveKit's original Agent Playground. You can use this or check out [LiveKit&#39;s original Agent Playground](https://github.com/livekit/agents-playground) for the full feature set.
- **Backend**: Located in the `back-end-python` directory, this part manages the voice assistant's logic and integrates with various APIs.
